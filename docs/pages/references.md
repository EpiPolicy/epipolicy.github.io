While specifying parameters and data for a simulation, users usually consult various sources such as published articles and research papers as well as open-source code repositories.

In **EpiPolicy**, users can keep track of references by using the built-in references management system. References can be added by clicking on the **+** button, present on all editable data fields across all sections. The dialog box that pops up when you press the **+** button is shown below:

## Types of References

In **EpiPolicy**, users can create three kinds of references:

1. ### Article
Articles are usually cited from published scientific literature. You can add these references in the form of BibTex and can also provide an optional description and a URL. An example is shown below:
<figure><img src="/assets/ref2.png" alt="drawing"/></figure>
2. ### Script
If your project uses software programs to determine parameters or other values, you can cite them by providing a URL to the location of the code repository. You can also provide any specific parameters that you used as input to the program. You can describe your usage in detail using the _Description_ textbox.
An example is shown below:
<figure><img src="/assets/ref3.png" alt="drawing"/>  </figure>
3. ### Note
You can use _Notes_ to describe your reasoning and details for any specific decision you made across any section of your simulation specification.
An example is shown below:
<figure><img src="/assets/ref5.png" alt="drawing"/></figure>

## Reusable References

Once a reference is created for any field in any section, **EpiPolicy** stores it in your project meta-data. The list of all references created in all sections can then be re-used wherever needed. This list can be accessed under the _re-use_ tab of the _Add A Reference_ dialog box. An example is shown below:

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/ref4.png" alt="drawing"/>  
</figure>
