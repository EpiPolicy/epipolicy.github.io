        Model-driven policy-making for epidemic control is a challenging and collaborative process. 
        It begins when a team of public-health officials, epidemiologists, and economists construct 
        a reasonably predictive disease model representative of the team’s administrative region as 
        a function of its unique socio-economic and demographic characteristics. As the team considers 
        possible interventions such as school closures, social distancing, vaccination drives, etc., 
        they need to simultaneously model each intervention’s effect on disease spread and economic cost. 
        The team then engages in an extensive what-if analysis process to determine a cost-effective policy: 
        a schedule of when, where and how extensively each intervention should be applied. This policy-making 
        process is often an iterative and laborious programming-intensive effort where parameters are introduced 
        and refined, model and intervention behaviors are modified, and schedules changed. We have 
        designed and developed EpiPolicy to support this effort. EpiPolicy is a policy aid and 
        epidemic simulation tool that supports the mathematical specification and simulation of 
        disease and population models, the programmatic specification of interventions and the 
        declarative construction of schedules. EpiPolicy’s design supports a separation of concerns 
        in the modeling process and enables capabilities such as the automatic exploration of 
        intervention plans with Monte Carlo simulations to find a cost-effective one. We report 
        expert feedback on EpiPolicy. In general, experts found EpiPolicy’s capabilities powerful 
        and transformative, when compared with their current practice.
