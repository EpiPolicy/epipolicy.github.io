EpiPolicy provides an autocompletion mechanism for users to assist them in specifying locales in various sections, such as Schedules, Facilities, Mobility, etc. 
The locales specification follows the regex syntax described [here](regex-syntax). 

As soon as you start typing in your locale, an autocomplete box will appear under the text field and will filter locales according to your input. 
You can continue to type or choose a suggested locale from the autocomplete box.
A dot (.) represents the next administrative level.
