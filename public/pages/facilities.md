Facilities are places within a locale where people may reside in or travel to for various activities. These may include schools, households, places of worship, workplaces, etc. A facility is used to model unique environments that affect disease dynamics and how often and how long different population groups reside in these environments.

In **EpiPolicy**, users can define the facilities they want to include in their simulation in the *Facilities* page.

First, users have to define the facilities they want to model by specifying a name for the facilitiy and, optionally, a description. 
In the following example, a user has defined two facilities: Households and School.

Users can also opt to utilize the built-in plugin to use [SynthPop](https://github.com/UDST/synthpop) to create and populate data for the following pre-defined facilities: Households, School, Workplace and Community. The SynthPop plugin can be accessed via the ``New`` button located at the top of the page.
