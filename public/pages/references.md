While specifying parameters and data for a simulation, users usually consult various sources such as published articles and research papers as well as open-source code repositories.

In **EpiPolicy**, users can keep track of references by using the built-in references management system. References can be added by clicking on the **+** button, present on all editable data fields across all sections.

In **EpiPolicy**, users can create three kinds of references:
1. Articles
    <img src="/assets/ref2.png" alt="drawing"/>       
2. Code
    <img src="/assets/ref3.png" alt="drawing"/>  
3. Notes
    <img src="/assets/ref5.png" alt="drawing"/>  

**EpiPolicy** also stores the list of all references created in all sections, which can then be re-used wherever needed.
