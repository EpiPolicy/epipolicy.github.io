## Introduction

In this tutorial, we explore the concept of a facility in **Epipolicy** with instructions on how to import the previous SIRD model in [Intro to Epipolicy's group](/intro_to_group) and create facilities where different groups will interact with each other.

A facility is a place in a locale where different groups such as seniors, adults or children interact with each other. There can be many facilities that are of interest in the context of an epidemic such as household, school, workplace, community, mosque, mall, etc.
