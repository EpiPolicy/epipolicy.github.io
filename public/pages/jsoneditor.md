All data and specifications in EpiPolicy are stored in the JSON notation. This allows advanced users to easily use EpiPolicy with other programming tools in their modeling arsenal, such as R or Python, as most softwares and programs offer functionalities to generate and manipulate JSON documents.

The JSON data relevant to each page is accessible via a built-in JSON editor present in all pages. 
Users are able to interact with and modify any data in the JSON editor, which will be reflected in the relevant sections on the page. 
However, users are advised to be mindful of the structure and format of the JSON format used by EpiPolicy, in case they want to modify anything.

An example of the JSON editor and the JSON specification of the Model page is presented below:
