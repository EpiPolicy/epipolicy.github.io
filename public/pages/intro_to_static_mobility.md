## Introduction

In this tutorial, we explore the concept of static mobility in **Epipolicy** with instructions on how to create and modify mobility values between locales in **EpiPolicy**.

Human mobility plays an important role in the spread of the disease. Whether via border or airplane, population in one locale can travel and spend their time in another locale. Infection incidences can, therefore, happen abroad. There are two types of mobility:
- **Static** mobility meaning that the mobility is considered as time spent in another locale. And hence there is no change to the total population of a locale when its population spends time in another locale.
- **Dynamic** mobility refers to the actual transfer of population from one locale to another locale. This can happen during significant demographic changes such as migration or evacuation.

In this tutorial, we explore how to do static mobility in **Epipolicy**. Dynamic mobility is introduced via [intervention tutorial](/).
