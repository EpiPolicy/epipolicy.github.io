EpiPolicy enables users to export their simulation specifications in JSON format. Users can share this JSON with their collaborators (who can import it in their own local EpiPolicy deployments) or use it within any other programming environments that support JSON notation. 

There is also an option to export your simulation in the form of a Python Jupyter Notebook package that you can run separately from the EpiPolicy interface. You can do this at the time of export by checking the "Launcher Code" option.

The export button is present at the bottom of the navigation menu on the left side of the screen. 
You can simply click on the button and provide a name for your export. 
Note that the exported JSON file consists of specification data from all sections/pages, except Results and Compare.

Similarly, you can click on the import button to import any JSON specification exported previously.


An example usage scenario is shown below.
