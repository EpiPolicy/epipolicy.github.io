<!-- ## Introduction

In this tutorial, we explore the concept of dynamic mobility in **Epipolicy** with instructions on how to implement them via **Epipolicy's intervention**.

Dynamic mobility refers to the transfer of population in one compartment of one locale to another compartment of another locale. This transfer changes the total population of the two involved locales with the exception of transfer between two compartments in a same locale.
