In summary, **Epipolicy** compartmental model involves the compartmental model itself with human mobility between locales and human interaction within facilities of a locale. It further makes a distinction of the transition rates in the compartmental model when looking at different population groups.
#### Terminologies:
- **Locale**: a geographical location or an administrative area that we would like our population to reside and travel between. Locales can be fine-grained as a city/province or can be coarse-grained as a country.
- **Facility**: a location within a locale that our population will spend time interacting with other population. Typical facilities are household, workplace, school, community space, etc.
- **Group** (short for population group): a distinctive demographic that would transition differently in the compartmental model. For example, seniors would be more likely to develop critical symptoms compared to adults.

*Model overview: Children of locale A spend 80% of the time within the locale while 20% travel to locale B. When staying at locale A, they spend 35% of the time in school. While at school, they spend mostly 90% interacting with other children*
