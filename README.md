## EpiPolicy Website Repository

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Markdown is used to build the pages. For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) for more information about GitHub Pages.
